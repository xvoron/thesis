\subsection{Sensors}
Sensors comparison, cost.

\subsection{Data exploring}
Data has been collect from 8 types of sensors corresponding table
\ref{tab:measured_signals}:
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        Signal name                   &   Description       \\     
               \hline
           FlowExtrusin               &   Flow sensor       \\
           FlowContraction            &   Flow sensor       \\
           AirPressure                &   Pressure sensor   \\
           AccelerometerMoving\_axisY &   Accelerometer     \\
           AccelerometerMoving\_axisY &   Position encoder  \\
                                      &   Accelerometer     \\
                                      &   Temperature sensor\\
                                      &   Proximity sensor  \\
                                      &   Strain gauge      \\ 
                                      &   Microphones       \\ 
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Measured signals}
    \label{tab:measured_signals}
\end{table}

There are 660 measurements with different parameters system parameters
\ref{tab:params}.
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        Adjusting valve 1 &  \\
        Adjusting valve 2 &  \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Device parameters}
    \label{tab:params}
\end{table}

Dataset was divided to 5 main categories.


\begin{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Data has been accumulated to ".mat" files.
Each file contains signals from sensors during 10 seconds measurements with
different pneumatic actuator configuration. Example results from one
experiment are represented in figures \ref{fig:data_exmp1},
\ref{fig:data_exmp2}. 


\subsection{Data management}
\paragraph{Data Ensembles}
Data files have been reshaped to Data Ensembles format used for Condition
monitoring purposes. This format allows processing data without copying the
whole dataset to memory at once but processes them one by one. In large datasets
it gives an option to manipulate with data without problems with allocated memory.

\subsection{Preprocessing}
Measured signals require preprocessing concerning the preservation of the information
base. For smoothing data Moving Average function were used.
As an example, the figure \ref{fig:preprocess} is shown the "raw" and filtered signals.
The whole dataset of preprocessed data is relatively big. For
time-saving, parallel computing was used for all computationally
demanding parts of the code.


\subsection{Condition Indicators extraction}

For classification task purpose from the signals have been extracted
statistical features such as mean, median, peak to peak value, etc.
As a condition "FaultCode" variable
were used. This variable represent configuration of pneumatic actuator
during the measurement.

All calculated features were added to the dataset and were ranked by
Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA algorithm. Following table \ref{tab:feat} contain
5 first best features ranked for classification purpose.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        1. & LeverPosition\_Stat\_Var & Lever position variance \\
        2. & StrainGauge\_Stat\_Mean  & Strain gauge mean value \\
        3. & StrainGauge\_Stat\_Skewness  & Strain gauge Skewness value \\
        4. & LeverPosition\_Stat\_RMS  & Lever position Root mean square
        level \\
        5. & LeverPosition\_Stat\_mean  & Lever position mean value \\ 
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{First 5 ranked features}
    \label{tab:feat}
\end{table}

\subsection{Classification Task}

The main goal of the classification task is to train a model that can
predict the "FaultCode" of pneumatic actuator configuration by
calculated features.
Respecting to table \ref{feat}, the first five features have been used to
find the best classification model for our data.
Principal component analysis (PCA) has been used to reduce the number of
features and chose the best representants.
The trained model has been exported to
\textbf{models/} directory.
The confusion matrix of the trained classification model shown in figure
\ref{fig:conf}. Model accuracy on validation data is $\approx 93 \%$
\ref{fig:pred}.
